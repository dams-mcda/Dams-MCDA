				"<br>This <b>free and open source</b> tool was developed to aid people like you in considering tradeoffs associated with dams. It can help support your consideration of possible decision alternatives (e.g. keep and maintain dam, \
				 improve hydropower generation, improve fish passage) for hydropower dams, and could potentially be tailored toward other types of dam decisions. The tool generates a data-driven recommendation for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \
         (FERC) licensed hydropower dams in Maine's Penobscot River, based on your preferences. This tool is based on the Weighted Sum approach to Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to compare decision-maker preferences for decision criteria \
         (e.g., annuitized cost, CO2 equivalent emissions reductions, sea-run fish habitat area, etc.) for hydropower dams with FERC license expiration dates in the next 10 years. The tool gathers user inputs and calculates a ranked set of decision \
         alternatives for each dam. Then, the tool optimizes across the set of dams coming up for relicensing to suggest a coordinated set of decision alternatives for multiple dams. The purpose of the coordinated multi-dam recommendation\
				 is to encourage you to consider dams on the river as a system, in addition to one at a time.\ <br>
				 <br><b>NOTE:</b> The results from this decision support tool are not official to any FERC licensing process and do not in any way represent the ruling of FERC.<br>"

				The Penobscot River is home to many dams and supports valuable ecosystem services. The watershed inclues pristine natural lakes, clean water sources, and significant biodiversity, including several sea-run fish species (e.g. Atlantic salmon, American eel, \
				Blueback herring, and Alewife). Dams also provide important services: reservoirs for drinking water and recreation, flood protection, and generation of reliable, on-demand renewable hydropower, critical to reducing fossil-fuel emissions that contribute \
				to climate change and poor human health. However, all dams need regular maintenance and older dams may need more extensive repairs as they age. Dams may interrupt flows and prevent sea-run fish passage, contributing to large population declines. \
				They may also contribute to poor water quality downstream, increased predation, and climate change (decaying plant matter in reservoirs release methane into the atmosphere). Dams have long threatened indigenous cultural traditions, while at the same \
				time helping to shape post-industrial town or city identities over the last two centuries.<br>"

				   criterion and decision alternatives. Step 5 (individual dams) results provide more detail about each individual dam. However, bear in mind that data for sea-run fish habitat area and river recreation are network-dependent, \
				   meaning that a change to one dam may affect results at another dam. Therefore, the numeric results in Step 5 may differ from what is presented here due to the site-specific nature of the fish habitat and river recreation decision \
				   criteria data estimates. The outcome presented here is a recommendation designed to support the coordinated consideration of multiple dams. This recommendation is intended to support brainstorming about possibilities for the river. \
				   This recommendation is not representative of any federal agency prescription or license ruling from FERC.<br>\
				   <br><b>Questions for consideration:</b> Do these results match your expectations? If not, why? If you feel discomfort at the result, you can return to the dam tabs and re-evaluate your criteria ratings. Remember to press \"Update\" under each tab. Then, return to this page and click GENERATE\
				   once more to see how your results change (note: you may want to download your results from this session, first).\
				   <br> Do these results make sense, given the tradeoffs you made in balancing the set of decision criteria for each dam? Recall that the decision criteria are fully compensating, meaning that as the preference value for one criterion increases, the value for another \
				   criterion must necessarily decrease. The idea here is to emphasize tradeoffs between decision criteria.<br>"

				"<b>Emma Fox </b>- Lead Developer (Ph.D. candidate, University of Maine Ecology and Environmental Science Program) for the Dam Decision Support Tool. Designed user interface and initial server functionality. Adjusted WSM function for new dam decision application and advised model-related changes. \
				Designed and wrote app text, and designed accompanying multi-dam decision example fact sheets, designed and wrote text for Dam Toolbox.<br> \
				<br><b>Dr. Sharon J. W. Klein </b>- Development Advisor (Associate Professor, University of Maine School of Economics). Helped develop and advise concept for the Dam Decision Support Tool, advised user-friendliness enhancements to the Dam Decision Support Tool and user interface/features, refined criteria \
				definitions, revised app text.<br> \
				<br><b>Dr. Samuel G. Roy </b>- Feature Developer (Postdoctoral Researcher, Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions, University of Maine) for the Dam Decision Support Tool. Created original Matlab scripts for multi-rank calculation, fitness functions for network-dependent criteria, and all maps.<br>\
				<br><b>William Winslow </b>- Developer (Software Engineer, GeoSpatial Science Center(GSSC), University of New Hampshire). Deployment (Docker, Apache), server code reorganization, debugging/bug fixes, misc. feature implementations for user interface and app function.<br>"
