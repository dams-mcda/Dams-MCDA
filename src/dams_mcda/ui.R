				"<br>This <b>free and open source</b> tool was developed to aid people like you in considering tradeoffs associated with dams. It can help support your consideration of possible decision alternatives (e.g. keep and maintain dam, \
				 improve hydropower generation, improve fish passage) for hydropower dams, and could potentially be tailored toward other types of dam decisions. The tool generates a data-driven recommendation for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \
         (FERC) licensed hydropower dams in Maine's Penobscot River, based on your preferences. This tool is based on the Weighted Sum approach to Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to compare decision-maker preferences for decision criteria \
         (e.g., annuitized cost, CO2 equivalent emissions reductions, sea-run fish habitat area, etc.) for hydropower dams with FERC license expiration dates in the next 10 years. The tool gathers user inputs and calculates a ranked set of decision \
         alternatives for each dam. Then, tool optimizes across the set of dams coming up for relicensing to suggest a coordinated set of decision alternatives for multiple dams. The purpose of the coordinated multi-dam recommendation\
				 is to encourage you to consider dams on the river as a system, in addition to one at a time.\ <br>
				 <br>The results from this decision support tool are not official to any FERC licensing process and do not in any way represent the ruling of FERC.<br>"

				The Penobscot River is home to many dams and supports valuable ecosystem services. The watershed inclues pristine natural lakes, clean water sources, and significant biodiversity, including several sea-run fish species (e.g. Atlantic salmon, American eel, \
				Blueback herring, and Alewife). Dams also provide important services: reservoirs for drinking water and recreation, flood protection, and generation of reliable, on-demand renewable hydropower, critical to reducing fossil-fuel emissions that contribute \
				to climate change and poor human health. However, all dams need regular maintenance and older dams may need more extensive repairs as they age. Dams may interrupt flows and prevent sea-run fish passage, contributing to large population declines. \
				They may also contribute to poor water quality downstream, increased predation, and climate change (decaying plant matter in reservoirs release methane into the atmosphere). Dams have long threatened indigenous cultural traditions, while at the same \
				time helping to shape post-industrial town or city identities over the last two centuries.<br>"
