				 "This R Shiny app supports decision making about a dam, using a set of decision criteria and decision alternatives identified using data from dam decision-maker interviews. The tool uses a Weighted Sum approach to Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to compare \
				 decision-maker preferences for decision criteria over a set of decision alternatives.<br>\

				 <br>Picture a watershed: rain falls and runs downhill toward tributaries that flow into the river and ultimately to the ocean. This watershed is home to valuable ecosystem services, including pristine natural lakes, clean water sources, and significant \
				 biodiversity, including several sea-run fish species (e.g. Atlantic salmon, American eel, Blueback herring, and Alewife). The river and its tributaries are home to many dams that also provide services, including reservoirs for drinking water and recreation, \
				 flood protection, and generation of reliable, on-demand renewable hydropower, critical to reducing emissions that contribute to climate change and poor human health. Dams across the U.S. are aging and pose potential safety hazards, increasing the need for \
				 regular maintenance or more extensive repair. Dams may interrupt flows and prevent sea-run fish passage, contributing to large population declines. They may also contribute to poor water quality downstream, increased predation, and climate change. Dams have \
				 long threatened indigenous cultural heritage in the U.S., while at the same time helping to shape post-industrial community identity over the last two centuries.<br>\

				 <br>For this activity, imagine that the future of a watershed is directly in your hands. You (the decision maker) are personally tasked with using your professional expertise to make sustainable decisions for a set of dams within a given watershed. \
				 In this MCDA tool, you will select a numeric score for each decision criterion (e.g., annuitized cost, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, sea-run fish survival, etc.) involved in each decision alternative (e.g., remove dam, keep dam, improve fish \

				 <br>Your Task: What do you envision for the future of this set of dams? Your task is to consider each of the decision alternatives for decisions across the set of dams:<br>\
				 <br>(1) Remove dam <br>\
				 (2) Improve fish passage facilities<br>\
				 (3) Improve hydropower generation<br>\
				 (4) Improve hydropower generation AND fish passage facilities<br>\
				 (5) Keep and maintain dam<br>\

				 <br>Please also consider the following decision criteria, to be applied in some combination for the set of dams:<br>\

				 <br>(1) Fish survival (thousands of lbs or metric tonnes per acre): proxy criteria estimated as sea-run fish (Atlantic salmon, Alewife, Blueback herring, American eel) biomass calculated using functional habitat units (Roy et al., 2018).<br>\
				 (2) River recreation area (square miles or kilometers): estimated area of river that may increase or decrease with a dam decision alternative, combines functional area for whitewater and flatwater recreation defined by Roy et al. (2018).<br>\
				 (3) Reservoir storage (cubic miles or kilometers): estimated storage potential of the reservoir, based on its volume (Roy et al., 2018).<br>\
				 (4) Annuitized project costs (2018 $USD): estimated total project costs (capital and operation & maintenance) on an annual basis using a 10% discount rate.<br>\
				 (5) Number of properties impacted: estimated number based on potential changes in viewshed or property value (Roy et al., 2018).<br>\
				 (6) Breach damage potential (unitless): a proxy for safety based on the State hazard rating, which indicates the potential for downstream property damage, injury, and death in the case of dam breach.<br>\
				 (7) Annual electricity generation (MWh/yr): estimate based on nameplate capacity.<br>\
				 (8) Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction (lbs or metric tonnes per year):  estimated based on avoided fossil fuel-generated electricity, using the State's energy mix.<br>\
				 (9) Indigenous cultural heritage (unitless): to convey the importance of the decision alternative for preserving/restoring the culture of indigenous people.<br>\
				 (10) Town/city identity (unitless): rating provided by decision-maker to convey the importance of the decision alternative for preserving the existing identity of the community of town/city residents.<br>\
				 (11) Industrial historical value (unitless): rating provided by the decision maker to convey the importance of the decision alternative for preserving/restoring the industrial historical value of the infrastructure.<br>\
				 (12) Aesthetic value (unitless): rating provided by the decision maker to convey the importance of the decision alternative for improving or preserving the aesthetics (e.g, appearance, scenic value, smell, sound).<br>\

				 <br> Toggle through the DECISION ALTERNATIVE pages at left to compare criteria under a single decision alternative and click UPDATE button to view decision alternative-specific results and mark the alternative COMPLETE. After you have finished rating criteria under every ALTERNATIVE tab, \
				 select the OUTPUT tab and click GENERATE to view the results.<br>\

				#"Alternative 1: Remove Dam",
				htmlOutput("Alt1"), # status and title
				HTML("When a dam is removed, water is allowed to flow (somewhat) freely downstream, creating greater connectivity for fish passage and river recreation, bolstering sea-run fish populations, and improving benthic (riverbed) aquatic communities. Dam removal may increase local water quality, \
					 regulate water temperature, and provide additional tourism/fishing opportunities. The river and its tributaries will likely return to their \"natural\" flows. However, dam removal may also create temporary mud flats as the reservoir empties, or release toxic or harmful impounded sediments. \
					 Dam removal eliminates lake-dwelling wildlife habitat and local flatwater recreation opportunities, reduces overall reservoir storage volume, and lowers total annual hydropower generation. Dam removal costs are typically high for dam removals, with no payback in terms of direct market returns. <br>\
					 <br>Warning: decision criteria ratings must sum to 1! The tracking indicator will help you keep track of the sum. Be aware that decision criteria are directly compensating (i.e., if the sum of all ratings is 1, then increasing the rating on one criterion requires another crterion rating to decrease in order to keep the sum equal to 1). <br>\
					 <br> Please consider and rate the given set of decision criteria based on the case of removing the dam. In each case, 0 = not at all important and 1 = extremely important.<br>"

					 or preserving the aesthetic value of the impoundment. Maintenance costs may be recouped somewhat if the dam is powered; however, refurbishment, restoration, or maintenance to a non-powered dam presents no direct opportunity for cost offset. Keeping the dam will likely have no \
					 impact on reservoir storage volume, river recreation area, annual electricity generation, or number of properties abutting the reservoir. The impoundment will continue to present a barrier to sea-run fish species, thereby negatively impacting their survival. And, in the long run, \
