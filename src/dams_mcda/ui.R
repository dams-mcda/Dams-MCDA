				 "The Dam Decision Support Tool supports preference elicitation for dam decision support, using a set of decision criteria and decision alternatives identified using data from dam decision-maker interviews. The tool uses an approach consistent with the \
				 Weighted Sum approach to Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to compare decision-maker preferences for decision criteria over a set of decision alternatives. Although this tool may be used on its own to elicit user preferences about dam decisions in \
				 general, it was designed to be used as part of the Dam Toolbox in an interactive workshop setting.<br> \

				 <br><b>Picture a watershed: </b>rain falls and runs downhill toward tributaries that flow into the river and ultimately to the ocean. This watershed is home to valuable ecosystem services, including pristine natural lakes, clean water sources, and significant \
						 biodiversity, including several sea-run fish species (e.g. Atlantic salmon, American eel, Blueback herring, and Alewife). The river and its tributaries are home to many dams. Dams provide important services: reservoirs for drinking water and recreation, \
						 flood protection, and generation of reliable, on-demand renewable hydropower, critical to reducing emissions that contribute to climate change and poor human health. However, dams across the U.S. are aging and pose potential safety hazards, increasing the\
				 need for regular maintenance or more extensive repair. Dams may interrupt flows and prevent sea-run fish passage, contributing to large population declines. They may also contribute to poor water quality downstream, increased predation, and climate change.\
				 Dams have long threatened indigenous cultural heritage in the U.S., while at the same time helping to shape post-industrial town or city identities over the last two centuries.<br>\

						 <br>In this Dam Decision Support Tool, <b>imagine that the future of a watershed is directly in your hands</b>. You (the decision maker) are personally tasked with using your professional expertise to make sustainable decisions for a set of dams within a \
				 given watershed. In each of the Alternative tabs, you will select a numeric rating for each decision criterion (e.g., annuitized cost, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, sea-run fish survival, etc.) involved in each decision alternative (e.g., remove dam,\
				 keep and maintain dam, improve fish passsage).<br>\

				 <h2>Specific Instructions</h2>\

				 Toggle through the DECISION ALTERNATIVE pages at left to compare decision criteria under a single decision alternative and click the UPDATE button at the bottom of each ALTERNATIVE page to view decision alternative-specific\
				 results and mark the alternative COMPLETE (i.e., to remove the red indicator message prompting user input). After you have finished rating decision criteria under ALL of the ALTERNATIVE tabs, select the OUTPUT tab and click GENERATE to view results. More\
				 information about the specific DECISION ALTERNATIVES and DECISION CRITERIA you will be considering during this exercise are listed below. If you are using this Dam Decision Support Tool  as a part of an interactive workshop facilitated by Future of Dams \

				 <h3>Decision Alternatives</h3> \

				 <ol>\
					 <li> Remove dam: dam is removed completely from the river, allowing water to flow freely </li>\
					 <li> Improve fish passage: some type of fish passage technology is installed (e.g., state-of-the-art fish lift/elevator, eel ladder, etc).</li> \
					 <li> Improve hydropower generation: (e.g., install turbines, upgrade turbines, or expand power capacity): hydropower generation capacity is increased, whether by installing new capacity or by upgrading turbines to larger power capacities or higher efficiency ratings; includes powered and non-powered dams.</li> \
					 <li> Improve hydropower generation AND fish passage: some type of fish passage technology is installed AND hydropower generation capacity is increased.</li> \
					 <li> Keep and maintain dam: this is the do-nothing option, where the dam remains in place and minimal costs are incurred to ensure dam structural integrity and safety compliance.</li> \
				 </ol>\

				 <h3>Decision Criteria</h3>\

				 <ol>\
					 <li> \
						 Fish survival (thousands of lbs or metric tonnes per acre): proxy criteria estimated as sea-run fish (Atlantic salmon, Alewife, Blueback herring, American eel) biomass calculated using functional habitat units (Roy et al., 2018). \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 River recreation area (square miles or kilometers): estimated area of river that may increase or decrease with a dam decision alternative, combines functional area for whitewater and flatwater recreation defined by Roy et al. (2019). \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Reservoir storage (cubic miles or kilometers): estimated storage potential of the reservoir, based on its volume (Roy et al., 2018).\
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Annuitized project costs (2018 $USD): estimated total project costs (capital and operation & maintenance) on an annual basis using a 6.2% discount rate and a 20 year lifetime. \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Number of properties impacted: estimated number of properties impacted by the decision alternative, based on potential changes in viewshed or property value (Roy et al., 2018). \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Breach damage potential (unitless): a proxy for safety based on the State hazard rating, which indicates the potential for downstream property damage, injury, and death in the case of dam breach (Roy et al., 2018). \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Annual electricity generation (MWh/yr): average estimate based on nameplate capacity from FERC licenses for each hydropower project.
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction (lbs or metric tonnes per year): estimate of avoided carbon dioxide emissions from annual hydropower-generated electricity production; based on decreasing generation from the State's electricity generation mix; does not include life cycle emissions impacts. \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Indigenous cultural heritage (unitless): a proxy for the importance of the decision alternative for preserving/restoring the culture of indigenous people. \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Town/city identity (unitless): rating to convey the importance of the decision alternative for preserving the existing identity of the community of town/city residents. \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Industrial historical importance (unitless): rating to convey the importance of the decision alternative for preserving/restoring the industrial historical value of the infrastructure. \
					 </li>\
					 <li> \
						 Aesthetic value (unitless): rating to convey the importance of the decision alternative for improving or preserving aesthetics (e.g., appearance, scenic value, smell, sound). \

				"Keeping and maintaining the dam is the closest to a \"do-nothing\" option included in this tool. It is the lowest-cost option. Keeping and maintaining the dam may appeal to parties interested in preserving the area's industrial history, preserving the town/city identity for \
				community residents (if local identity is closely tied to the dam), or preserving the aesthetic value of the impoundment. Maintenance costs may be recouped somewhat if the dam is powered; however, refurbishment, restoration, or maintenance to a non-powered dam presents no direct \
				opportunity for cost offset. Keeping the dam will likely have no impact on reservoir storage volume, river recreation area, annual electricity generation, or number of properties abutting the reservoir. The impoundment will continue to present a barrier to sea-run fish species, \
				thereby negatively impacting their survival. And, in the long run, the dam is a temporary piece of infrastructure that may need to be removed. <br>\
				<br><b>Warning: decision criteria ratings must sum to 1!</b> The tracking indicator will help you keep track of the sum. Be aware that decision criteria are directly compensating (i.e., if the sum of all ratings is 1, then another criterion rating must decrease in order to keep the sum equal to 1). <br>\
				<br> Please consider and rate the given set of criteria based on the case of keeping and maintaining the dam. <b>In each case, 0 = not at all important and 1 = extremely important.</b><br>"

				  <br><b>Questions for consideration:</b><br>\

					<br> Do these results match your expectations? If not, why? If you feel discomfort at the result, you can return to the decision alternative tabs and re-evaluate your criteria ratings. Remember to press \"Update\" under each Alternative tab. Then, return to the Output page and click GENERATE\
					once more to see how your results change (note: you may want to download your results from this session, first).<br>\

					<br> Do these results make sense, given the tradeoffs you made in balancing the set of decision criteria under each decision alternative? Recall that the decision criteria are fully compensating, meaning that as the preference value for one increases, the value for another \
					must necessarily decrease. The idea here is to emphasize tradeoffs between decision criteria.<br> \

					<br><b>NEXT STEPS</b>: If you are participating in the Dam Decision-Making Workshop, the numerical preference values you entered in this Dam Decision Support Tool will be used to generate an optimized multi-dam decision scenario. This scenario, or collection of dams with different decision \
					 alternative results, is created using a Weighted Sum Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) with Multi-Objective Genetic Algortihm (MOGA). Your preference values, entered here, help the MCDA-MOGA to identify the 'optimal' outcome. Please download your results at this time."
