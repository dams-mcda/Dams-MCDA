However, dam removal may also create temporary mud flats as the reservoir empties, or release toxic or harmful impounded sediments. <br>\
            Dam removal eliminates lake-dwelling wildlife habitat and local flatwater recreation opportunities, reduces overall reservoir storage volume, and lowers total annual hydropower generation.
