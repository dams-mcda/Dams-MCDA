Matlab
--------------------------
A matlab installation media ISO is required to be mounted on the host machine

~~~bash
sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop <matlab installation ISO path> <mount location>
~~~

if <mount location> is somewhere other than /media/mathworks edit docker-compose.yml to reflect the changes

~~~yml
      - /media/mathworks:/media/mathworks
~~~
to
~~~yml
      - <mount location>:/media/mathworks
